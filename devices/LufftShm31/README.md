## Wiring

Ensure the device is connected to a serial port on the board using RS485 half-duplex.
**Note:** this is dependent on the board, so we only list the colours used by the supplied interface cable and the corrosponding pins on the sensor connector.

| Connnector | Wire Colour | Description |
|:--|--|--|
| RS485_A | Green | (sensor connector pin 5). |
| RS485_B | Yellow | (sensor connector pin 2). |
| RS485_GND | Grey | (sensor connector pin 4) - Not required. |
| HEATING_TRIGGER | Red | (sensor connector pin 3) - Not required. |
| VDC_IN_+ (12 or 24) | Brown | (sensor connector pin 8). |
| VDC__IN_- (0) | White | (sensor connector pin 7). |

## Usage

* Ensure the device is configured to Modbus RTU using UMB ConfigTool.NET.


```csharp

```


## Limitations

* Modbus RTU using RS485 half-duplex is the only supported implementation.
* Polling should only be attempted at 1 second intervals or above.
